Today is another extraordinary day. I didn't do the experiment in the morning. The RFID teacher said that I didn't do well in the final exam. I can only be regarded as above average in my class. I have to go home in the afternoon. There are still two experiments that haven't been finished. I'm very anxious. Why is the computer major so difficult.
